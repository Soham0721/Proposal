                            I hope this message finds you well🥰. Over the time we've spent together, I've come to admire and cherish our connection🫂. You bring so much joy and positivity into my life❣️, and I find myself thinking about you constantly babyy🫀. Today, I want to express my feelings for you openly.  So here it goes, I care for you deeply and have developed strong feelings for you babyy💌. I believe that we share a special bond my love💘. Would you consider being my partner for whole life👩‍❤‍👨, and explore a deeper and more committed relationship together💓?? Aur mujhe lagta h ki ab tumhe time nhi chaiye hoga kyuki apan ne bhot time saath beetaya h 7th may se aaj tk and I respect whatever decision you make means you have to say yes now (today for the first time I'm forcing a girl to say yes but now you are my girl, toh mera haqq banta h😂😂). Your happiness and comfort are most important to me😘. I look forward to hearing yes from you, and I want to spend my future with you and I hope you also want to spend ur future with me🤌.I love you babyy💌. These are my true words and true feelings for you and these words came from my heart only for you babyyy. I love you so much.<br>
